# Project Planning Wireframes Practice

Now that you've learned how to do some basic wireframing, let's actually put those skills to work by getting a jump on the first project.

For your first project, you will be making an in-browser Tic Tac Toe game that can be played on a phone, tablet, or computer.  Although you have a lot of freedom with what the UI looks like, it will need the following features in order to be used properly:

-   a form (or two separate forms) for registering a new account and logging in
-   a clickable game board that you can use to play the game
-   something to display who won, once a game ends
-   a way to start a new game (e.g. a button, or a model window)

On your own, draft up a set of sketches to start from as you begin to design your app's front end; you should have at least one sketch for what the site looks like on a mobile device and one for what the site looks like on a laptop. These sketches should be lightweight and rough so that you can easily iterate on them if you decide to add or remove features.

**These drafts do not need to be submitted. The final version of your wireframes will need to be submitted along with the rest of your project at the end of the unit.**
